UPA-nomics: High growth plus high inflation equals worse child malnutrition:-
One of the great myths about poverty alleviation and the elimination of hunger and malnutrition is that you have to keep throwing money at the problem. Being pro-poor means flinging money and schemes in the direction of the poor; the quality of the intervention and macroeconomic outcomes of the same policies do not matter much.

In the Sonia Gandhi-led UPA scheme of things, high inflation was an acceptable side-effect of high growth and high social spends that were effectively targeting votes rather than real human development. The high growth rates that coincided with UPA-1 delivered high tax revenues which enabled high social spending, including a large farm loan waiver. But the same splurge brought UPA-2 to grief when the government bankrupted itself by shifting money from the productive sectors of the economy to rural areas.
Somewhere at the start of its second term in office, when the seedcorn for fast growth was being consumed, the UPA continued with high non-merit subsidies and rural spending, resulting in high inflation. It paid the price in 2014 not only because of the scams that surfaced during 2010-2013, but because it landed the economy in the ditch, destroying both growth and purchasing power in rural areas. UPA-2’s worst legacy was structural inflation.
An empirical study in Andhra Pradesh provides us with strong evidence that persistent inflation can be a poverty and malnutrition booster - something which cannot be eliminated merely by bunging in more schemes for the poor. Macroeconomic outcomes like structural inflation are the result of misplaced fiscal policies driven by the wrong kind of consumption spending, and these directly impact the level of hunger and malnutrition in the country.
A report in The Indian Express yesterday (9 July) quotes a long-term study on the impact of inflation on malnutrition and found a strong causal link between the two. More inflation leads to more malnutrition. It’s commonsense, for more inflation means lower food purchasing power for the poor. The study was conducted by Oxford University, the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and published in the Journal of Nutrition.

NREGA and after: Large-scale migration of rural masses is back in Chhattisgarh:-
Raipur - After a lull of nearly seven years, large-scale migration of rural masses in search of livelihood is back in news in Chhattisgarh again.
While the state government has informed the assembly that nearly one lakh people have left their homes and migrated in search of job in the state in the last three years, conservative non-official estimates put the figure at more than 20 lakhs.
<br>

The period of lull coincides with the period the previous UPA government pushed its rural safety net programme, MNREGA, with much enthusiasm; the change has come with the Raman Singh government going slow on it in the state after the Centre reduced allocation to the state government. The rural economy, which witnessed a period of calm - some would call it artificial calm - is back in the turbulent mode.
“The ground situation is far more worrisome than the figures of the migration suggest,” says T Singh Deo, the leader of the opposition in the state assembly. “People migrate either in search of better wage or when there is no wage. This year the change in the central government's policy drastically cut down the income of the farmers by first refusing to buy paddy and then by withholding distribution of the promised bonus. The spending power of the farmers shrunk. To add to the misery of the rural people, the state government faltered on starting the employment generating programmes under MGNREGA. Combined, these two factors have rendered a devastating blow to the rural economy leaving lakhs of landless as well as the small and marginal farmers with no option but to migrate in search of jobs and wages,” believes Singh Deo.
The government bases its figures essentially on the number of permits for migration it issues under the interstate migrant workmen act. 1979. The bulk of the migration takes place without the official license. Besides, it overlooks the migration within the state or even districts. Even these figures tell a story.
According to the official figures of the state, in Bilaspur district 17796 people migrated in 2006 – the year MGNREGA was introduced. The figure kept coming down steadily and in 2010, it was only 1,223. No figures are available for the later years.
Chhattisgarh was first recognised nationally as a supplier of cheap labour towards the end of the 19th century when, immediately after the completion of the Eastern segment of the Howrah-Bombay rail link, thousands of labour from the famine struck plains were carted to the tea gardens of Assam.
The trend became a habit and then a forced way of life in over hundred years thereafter, until MGNREGA - the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act - which the World Bank termed a "stellar example of rural development" in its World Development Report 2014 - arrived in the middle of the last decade. It was the first constitutionally supported measure to help the land-less poor and small farmers to get work in their village at reasonable wages.
The scheme brought migration down drastically. More importantly it provided an upward pressure on the baseline wages and thereby gave a boost to the bargaining capacity of the poor. With the drastic shift of the rural labour from the agricultural to the MGNREGA-backed infrastructure and other non-farm sector, the land holding class in the villages panicked in its reactions in the initial years.
The policies of the state government, preparing to go to the assembly elections first in 2008 and then in 2013, helped in no small measure in bringing the rural economy to its present status.
Keen to please both the segments of the rural society at the same time, it first distributed ration cards to all and sundry and made them eligible to buy rice at virtually no price. This decreased their appetite for work. The absence of hands from the field brought the wages at par with the MGNREGA.
The farmers or the land holders were pampered with the ‘unlimited’ amount of paddy that they were allowed to sell to the government at the minimum support price. This turned tractor owner farmers into smugglers of paddy that was available in the neighbouring states at a cheaper price and to sell it to the government and lay claims on the bonus.
Flush with surplus money, the landowners lost no time in going shopping for the farm equipment like, tractors, trolleys, harvesters and thrashers.
The vacuum created by the departure of the manual help in the agriculture sector was filled up by the machines, plugging to a large extent the window of opportunity for the rural labour to return to the farms.
With the change of the government in Delhi after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the scenario took another ‘U’ turn. The rural economy turned upside down yet again, this time for the worse. The uglier contours of the changed face are coming to the fore now.
First, the Centre tightened its purse strings and the state government, in spite of a much-trumpeted promise in its election manifesto to the contrary, refused to buy paddy from the farmers beyond a rather token quantity. The list of eligible farmers to sell paddy was drastically pruned. No bonus was given.
This gave a deadly blow to the income and purchasing power of the farmer. Neeraj Patel of Botalda near Raigarh is the leading dealer of established brands of farm equipment in Chhattisgarh. He says after the graph of sale going up and up in the past couple of years, it has nose-dived this year. The worse is, he continues, that the farmers are not in a position to repay the loans on the equipments bought earlier.
The labours and the marginal and small farmers were hit harder.
The Modi government immediately after taking over betrayed intentions of giving a re-look to the MGNREGA programmes. The speculated changes were drastic pruning of the area of coverage; cutting down the wage component of the programme; curtailing the central government’s share of funds etc. Whatever the stated intentions of the government were, the indifference had a crippling effect on the state’s rural economy as it spread uncertainty about the scheme.
The road map of the work that the government plans to take up in the non-farming months under the scheme used to go public towards the end of the kharif season. It didn’t happen this year. The labour after a wait of few work-less weeks was forced to look for other avenues. The option of going back to the agriculture sector had almost lapsed with the arrival of the machines and the diminished spending power of the farmers. The fact that in many areas of the state, the dues of the last years’ work were not cleared, added to the urgency to look for options.
The migration was triggered as a natural corollary. According to the government's admission in the assembly, the migration has taken place from virtually every part of the state. The maximum number of people migrated from the Champa-Janjgir district.
The state government has inked MoU with 34 companies with plans to set up as many power plants in this district alone. The proposed power plants with a total capacity of about 34,000 MW will require about 40,000 acre of land, most of which was irrigated agricultural fields till the acquisitions started.
“A total of around 10,000 acres is the requirement of the industry in one Dabhra block alone of this district,” says Murlidhar Chandram of ‘Srijan Kendra’ a Dabhra based NGO active in the agricultural sector. In Chhattisgarh, 82.56 percent population lives in 20,376 villages. About 80 percent population of the state has traditionally depended on agro economy. The Champa-Janjgir district is no exception.
The state has entered what portends to be the worst slow down in the recent years.

Budget 2015: Here's how FM Jaitley can get his fund allocation right:-
As the budget making process enters the final stages, the calls for a path-breaking budget heralding big-bang reforms are getting louder. But most of the big-ticket reforms are off-budget matters.
Subsidies can be pruned only by the administrative ministries; labour law amendments can be initiated only by the labour ministry. Technically, the budget is nothing more than an accounting exercise, which has just become a vehicle for policy grand-standing.
<br>
<img src="Arun-Jaitley4_PTI.jpg" hight=300 width=300><br>

An accounting exercise simply involves balancing the books and allocating money to different uses (departments in the case of the government). Some get more, some get lots more and others get neither more nor less. None, in fact, get less and that is what is wrong with the exercise. There are ministries whose budgets could do with some slashing, freeing up money for other ministries that will need more.
So which are the ministries that Jaitley should give less to?
We can start with the culture ministry, with a budget allocation of Rs 2,511 crore. Should promotion of culture be a government’s responsibility?
Look at all that goes under the head of promotion and dissemination of art and culture – Rs 5 crore each for “International culture Activities and Grants to Indo-Friendship Society” and “Scheme on Intangible Culture Heritage”, Rs 101 crore for zonal cultural centres (a more than double increase over last year’s allocation), Rs 90 crore for centenaries and anniversary celebrations (fortunately this saw a slight cut from last year’s Rs 100 crore).
Perhaps the government needs to play a role in maintaining national archives and museums, but does it need to be managing libraries as well? Why should there be a National Mission on Libraries, Leading to the Formation of a Commission with a budget of Rs 57 crore?
There’s huge scope for pruning the budget of this ministry, which has seen an 80 percent increase between 2012-13 and 2014-15.
Textiles is another ministry whose budget can either be cut or frozen, preferably the former. Do we need a dedicated ministry running schemes to promote handlooms and powerlooms, for fashion and textile education and rehabilitation of textiles labour, manage boards for wool and silk and piloting a Jute Technology Mission?
The bulk of the outlay of the ministry of heavy industries and public enterprises (Rs 1,261 crore) is on propping up ailing public sector undertakings. If the government is not going to put these enterprises on the block, it can at least stop putting more money into them.
Does the agriculture ministry need a Rs 31,000 crore budget when much of the action is in the states? Why on earth is the Delhi Milk Scheme still being propped up, with a budget allocation of Rs 16 crore? DMS was started to supply milk to Delhi at a subsidised rate. Until Mother Dairy came on the scene, it was the only organised supplier of milk in the Capital. But now there are any number of packaged milk providers and the traditional gwalas.
There is very little case for pumping in more money into the civil aviation ministry. Of the allocation of Rs 7,377 crore, over Rs 4,000 crore is gobbled up by Air India, Pawan Hans, Hotel Corporation of India and Air India Charters. Go ahead, give more to the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security and the Airports Authority of India but do these bleeding enterprises deserve more? The Haj subsidy has been coming down over the years, but isn’t it time to do away with it?
Many of these allocations are piddly amounts, really, and cutting these will be like emptying the ocean with a bucket. There are far bigger expenditure cuts that need to be done – on NREGA, the National Food Security Act and the like.
Unfortunately, these are politically extremely difficult and the government may not want to tread this minefield right away. But let’s not forget that ditty – little drops of water/little grains of sand/make the mighty ocean/and the distant land. Every crore saved by compressing allocations to the ministries mentioned – and there are many, many more like these - can be pushed into other more deserving ministries. What are they?
The infrastructure ministries, for one. There’s a pressing need to plug the huge infrastructure gap the country faces and it is infrastructure which is going to give the growth engine a big shove. The financing needs of the sector are humungous and budgetary provisions alone may not be enough, but these can be used to leverage other forms of investment.
The ministries of drinking water and sanitation and water resources (which looks after irrigation) should also not be grudged more money. Potable drinking water, sanitation and irrigation are huge challenges that the country needs to meet.
Social infrastructure also needs a financing thrust. The health ministry made news a month back because of a 20 percent cut in its budget, the reason for which is still not known. Health is an important issue and should not normally be the subject of cuts. Instead the health budget needs enhancing, especially allocations for the national disease control programmes.
That does not mean there’s no scope for cutting in the overall ministry budget. There’s a serious need to curb spending on the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), which provides medical facilities to Central government employees and their families as well as pensioners, MPs, ex-MPs, ex-governors, retired judges, freedom fighters, accredited journalists – it’s a huge list.
The system is inefficient and a huge source of corruption, especially in the purchase of medicines. And yet it sits on prime real estate across the country and has a huge staff of doctors, nurses. There has been talk of phasing it out and replacing it with a medical insurance scheme but it has remained only talk. There’s little point in pumping in Rs 800 crore a year into CGHS. This needs to be pared down.
